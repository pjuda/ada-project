# How open is the science?

# Abstract
Scientists more frequently tweet about their research.
The open science and open data in research is becoming increasingly popular.
We would like to check what universities support the open science idea
and quantify how open is EPFL and other swiss institutions compared to rest of the world.

# Research questions
Develop metrics for openess in science.
Does visibility of research correlate with open science?
Compare EPFL with other universities in terms of openess.
Compare Switzerland, where there is strong open science policy with other countries.

# Dataset
Twitter database.
If possible, could also track the open science time evolution.
